1. css/ – Cascading Style Sheets
This folder contains all the compiled Bootstrap stylesheets (usually in .css format). It is used to style the HTML elements consistently across your site.

Typical files inside css/:
bootstrap.css: The full, unminified version of Bootstrap's CSS. Easier to read and edit if needed.

bootstrap.min.css: The minified version, optimized for performance (smaller file size, faster load times).

bootstrap-grid.css / bootstrap-grid.min.css: Contains only the grid system styles (for responsive layouts), without other Bootstrap components.

bootstrap-reboot.css / bootstrap-reboot.min.css: Contains the Reboot module, which resets browser inconsistencies in styling.

bootstrap-utilities.css: Contains utility classes only, for custom layouts or tweaks.

Purpose: Provides styling rules for layout, components (buttons, modals, navbars), utilities, and responsive design.

This folder includes all the JavaScript functionality that Bootstrap offers to enhance interactivity and dynamic behavior in your web pages.

bootstrap.bundle.min.js: Minified version of the bundle.

bootstrap.js: Only Bootstrap’s JavaScript code, without Popper.js.

bootstrap.min.js: Minified version of the above.
